# Recipe Manager

### What will this application do?

This application will help organize and store an ever-growing 
list of recipes in a collection. The user will be able to add/view
each individual recipe with ingredients, and instructions that are easy to follow.
As well, it will provide suggestions for possible recipes that can be made with given ingredients.

### Who is it for?

This recipe manager application will be helpful for people with kitchen skills of all
levels who are looking for a way to organize their favorite recipes. It will
also help with planning meals as the application will also be able to 
suggest recipes with ingredients on hand.


### Why a Recipe Manager?

I chose to create a Recipe Manager because cooking is a hobby of mine that I enjoy.
However, I often ran into the problem of not knowing what to cook
or what recipes I could make with ingredients I had on hand. The recipe manager
is helpful because it stores all possible recipes in a convenient list for the user.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add a recipe to a Cookbook.
- As a user, I want to be able to view all my recipes that are contained in my cookbook. 
- As a user, I want to create my own recipe with a name, ingredients, and instructions.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete a recipe that was added to the Cookbook.


###References/Process
 
Initially, my classes were structured such that Recipe took in Lists of 
Strings to handle the ingredient/instruction component. I later made the design
decision to reference the package structure from the FitLifeGym starter file to give the
recipe components their own classes.
